```

## Connection sets

A connection set is used to connect multiple components together. Multiple connections can be easily created in parallel within one connection set, by specifying a list of individual pins (for `connectors`) or wires (for `cables`) for every component along the way.

```yaml
connections:
  -                # Each list entry is a connection set
    - <component>    # Each connection set is itself a list of items
    - <component>    # Items must alternatingly belong to the connectors and cables sections
    -...

  - # example (single connection)
    - <connector>: <pin>   # attach one pin of the connector
    - <cable>:     <wire>  # attach one wire of the cable
    - <connector>          # for simple connectors, pin 1 is implicit
    - <cable>:     s       # for shielded wires, s attaches to the shield

  - # example (multiple parallel connections)
    - <connector>: [<pin>,  ..., <pin> ]  # attach multiple pins in parallel
    - <cable>:     [<wire>, ..., <wire>]  # attach multiple wires in parallel
    - <connector>                         # auto-generate a new connector for every parallel connection
    - <cable>:     [<wire>-<wire>]        # specify a range of wires to attach in parallel
    - [<connector>, ..., <connector>]     # specify multiple simple connectors to attach in parallel
                                          # these may be unique, auto-generated, or a mix of both

```

- Each connection set is a list of components.
- The minimum number of items is two.
- The maximum number of items is unlimited.
- Items must alternatingly belong to the `connectors` and the `cables` sections.
- When a connection set defines multiple parallel connections, the number of specified `<pin>`s and `<wire>`s for each component in the set must match. When specifying only one designator, one is auto-generated for each connection of the set.
- `<pin>` may reference a pin's unique ID (as per the connector's `pins` attribute, auto-numbered from 1 by default) or its label (as per `pinlabels`).
- `<wire>` may reference a wire's number within a cable/bundle, its label (as per `wirelabels`) or, if unambiguous, its color.

### Single connections

#### Connectors

- `- <designator>: <int/str>, <str>__<int>` attaches a pin of the connector, referring to a pin number (from the connector's `pins` attribute) or a pin label (from its `pinlabels` attribute), provided the label is unique.

- `- <designator>` is allowed for simple connectors, since they have only one pin to connect.
For connectors with `autogenerate: true`, a new instance, with auto-generated designator, is created.

#### Cables

- `<designator>: <wire>` attaches a specific wire of a cable, using its number.

### Multiple parallel connections

#### Connectors

- `- <designator>: [<pin>, ..., <pin>]`

  Each `<pin>` may be:

  - `<int/str>` to refer to a specific pin, using its number (from its `pins` attribute) or its label (from its `pinlabels` attribute, provided the label is unique for this connector)

  - `<int>-<int>` auto-expands to a range, e.g. `1-4` auto-expands to `1,2,3,4`; `9-7` will auto-expand to `9,8,7`.
  - <str>__<int> where str is the name of the pin and int is it's number. This can be used to
	  differentiate pins which have the same label (i.e. GND)

  - Mixing types is allowed, e.g. `[<pin>, <pinlabel>, <pin>-<pin>, <pin>]`

- `- [<designator>, ..., <designator>]`

  Attaches multiple different single pin connectors, one per connection in the set.
  For connectors with `autogenerate: true`, a new instance, with auto-generated designator, is created with every mention.
  Auto-generated and non-autogenerated connectors may be mixed.

- `- <designator>`

  Attaches multiple instances of the same single pin connector, one per connectioin in the set.
  For connectors with `autogenerate: true`, a new instance, with auto-generated designator, is created for every connection in the set.
  Since only connectors with `pincount: 1` can be auto-generated, pin number 1 is implicit.

#### Cables

- `<designator>: [<wire>, ..., <wire>]`

  Each `<wire>` may be:

  - `<int>` to refer to a specific wire, using its number.
  - `<int>-<int>` auto-expands to a range.
  - `<str>` to refer to a wire's label or color, if unambiguous.

```
## Metadata entries

```yaml
  # Meta-information describing the harness

  # Valus supported can be found in src/wireviz/metadata.py

```

## Options

```yaml
  # Common attributes for the whole harness.
  # All entries are optional and have default values.

  # Background color of diagram and HTML output
  bgcolor: <color>             # Default = 'WH'

  # Background color of other diagram elements
  bgcolor_node: <color>        # Default = 'WH'
  bgcolor_connector: <color>   # Default = bgcolor_node
  bgcolor_cable: <color>       # Default = bgcolor_node
  bgcolor_bundle: <color>      # Default = bgcolor_cable

  # How to display colors as text in the diagram
  # 'full' : Lowercase full color name
  # 'FULL' : Uppercase full color name
  # 'hex'  : Lowercase hexadecimal values
  # 'HEX'  : Uppercase hexadecimal values
  # 'short': Lowercase short color name
  # 'SHORT': Uppercase short color name
  # 'ger'  : Lowercase short German color name
  # 'GER'  : Uppercase short German color name
  color_mode: <str>            # Default = 'SHORT'

  # Fontname to use in diagram and HTML output
  fontname: <str>              # Default = 'arial'

  # If True, show only a BOM entry reference together with basic info
  # about additional components inside the diagram node (connector/cable box).
  # If False, show all info about additional components inside the diagram node.
  mini_bom_mode: <bool>        # Default = True
```


## BOM items and additional components

Connectors (both regular, and auto-generated), cables, and wires of a bundle are automatically added to the BOM,
unless the `ignore_in_bom` attribute is set to `true`.
Additional items can be added to the BOM as either part of a connector or cable or on their own.

Parts can be added to a connector or cable in the section `<additional-component>` which will also list them in the graph.

```yaml
-
  type: <str>  # type of additional component
  # all the following are optional:
  subtype: <str>  # additional description (only shown in bom)
  qty: <int/float>  # qty to add to the bom (defaults to 1)
  qty_multiplier: <str>  # multiplies qty by a feature of the parent component
                  # when used in a connector:
                  # pincount         number of pins of connector
                  # populated        number of populated positions in a connector
                  # when used in a cable:
                  # wirecount        number of wires of cable/bundle
                  # terminations     number of terminations on a cable/bundle
                  # length           length of cable/bundle
                  # total_length     sum of lengths of each wire in the bundle
  unit: <str>
  pn: <str>            # [internal] part number
  manufacturer: <str>  # manufacturer name
  mpn: <str>           # manufacturer part number
  supplier: <str>      # supplier name
  spn: <str>           # supplier part number
  bgcolor: <color>     # Background color of entry in diagram component box
```

Alternatively items can be added to just the BOM by putting them in the section `<bom-item>` above.

```yaml
-
  description: <str>
  # all the following are optional:
  qty: <int/float>  # qty to add to the bom (defaults to 1)
  unit: <str>
  designators: <List>
  pn: <str>            # [internal] part number
  manufacturer: <str>  # manufacturer name
  mpn: <str>           # manufacturer part number
  supplier: <str>      # supplier name
  spn: <str>           # supplier part number
```

## Images

Both connectors and cables accept including an image with a caption within their respective nodes.

```yaml
image:
  src: <path>        # path to the image file
  # optional parameters:
  caption: <str>     # text to display below the image
  bgcolor: <color>   # Background color of entry in diagram component box
  width: <int>       # range: 1~65535; unit: points
  height: <int>      # range: 1~65535; unit: points
  # if only one dimension (width/height) is specified, the image is scaled proportionally.
  # if both width and height are specified, the image is stretched to fit.
```

For more fine grained control over the image parameters, please see [`advanced_image_usage.md`](advanced_image_usage.md).


## Multiline strings

The following attributes accept multiline strings:
- `type`
- `subtype` (connectors only)
- `notes`
- `manufacturer`
- `mpn`
- `supplier`
- `spn`
- `image.caption`

### Method 1

By using `|`, every following indented line is treated as a new line.

```yaml
attribute: |
  This is line 1.
  This is line 2.
```

### Method 2

By using double quoted strings, `\n` within the string is converted to a new line.

```yaml
attribute: "This is line 1.\nThis is line 2."
```

Plain (no quotes) or single quoted strings do not convert `\n`.

See [yaml-multiline.info](https://yaml-multiline.info/) for more information.

## Inheritance

[YAML anchors and references](https://blog.daemonl.com/2016/02/yaml.html) are useful for defining and referencing information that is used more than once in a file, e.g. when using defining multiple connectors of the same type or family. See [Demo 02](../examples/demo02.yml) for an example.
